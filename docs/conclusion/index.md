# Conclusion

When creating the RESTful API, I used the node.js framework with such tools as: express, mysql2, and body-parser.
Creating a RESTful service using node is a fairly easy and fast task, thanks to the express tool, you can quickly create a server for client-database interaction. I also used mysql2 to connect the database to the server correctly. When programming client requests such as POST and PATCH, I used the ‘body-parser’ tool to comfortably transfer data to the database using the JSON format.
